# Queuing System in JavaScript  

## Overview  

The Queuing System in JavaScript is a simple and efficient implementation of a queue data structure. This system allows for the management of tasks in a first-come, first-served order, making it ideal for scenarios where tasks need to be processed.  

## Features  

- **Enqueueing**: Add items to the end of the queue.  
- **Dequeuing**: Remove items from the front of the queue.  
- **Peek**: View the front item of the queue without removing it.  
- **Size**: Get the number of items in the queue.  
- **Empty Check**: Verify if the queue is empty.
